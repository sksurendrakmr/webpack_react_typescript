src folder - This will hold our source
build folder - This will contains all the files and artifacts when we 
build our react application for deployment.

tsconfig.json file will be used for type checking and not for code transpilation.
For code transpilation, we will use BABEL.

React code which we have configured is not understood by browser as it. We need BABEL
to convert the typescript and react code into javascript.
